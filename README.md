WeCare: Virtual Healthcare Assistant
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the way outpatient treatment is provided in medical facilities. In order to reduce the possibility of spreading the virus to patients or healthcare personnel in their practise, physicians are postponing preventive and elective appointments, such yearly physicals. Additionally, a lot of patients are avoiding appointments because they don't want to expose themselves by leaving their houses. The changing municipal and state travel restrictions also have an impact on the behaviour of physicians and patients.

Features desired in the application:
1. Video consultation with doctor
2. Book an appointment with doctor for physical visit
3. Doctors can give the prescription through the application
4. The application should save the medical history including the doctorâ€™s prescription.
5. Patients can purchase medicines from the application and book lab tests

The solution can also provide general medical assistance which will be useful in cases of emergencies.

authentication, and peer js / Socket / **WebRTC** for real-time communication.
